# Electromagnetically Induced Transparency (EIT) Repository

## Description

Welcome to the Electromagnetically Induced Transparency (EIT) Repository. This repository contains the Python code from a project completed in 2020 as part of a graduate degree. The purpose of this project was to simulate the EIT effect in a theoretical quantum system. The code uses the NumPy and Matplotlib libraries and is structured modularly for easy testing and comparison of different parameters.

## Background

Electromagnetically Induced Transparency (EIT) is a coherent optical effect in atomic media, where a medium normally opaque at a certain wavelength becomes transparent under the influence of a control electromagnetic field. This project involved simulating the EIT effect in a theoretical quantum system to understand and analyze various aspects and behaviors. A write-up of this project can be downloaded from [Simulating electromagnetically induced transparency
and its potential for quantum computing](yoder_electromagnetically_induced_transparency.pdf).

## Installation

Before cloning and running this repository, ensure you have Python installed on your computer and the NumPy and Matplotlib libraries. From your command line:

```bash
# Clone this repository
$ git clone https://github.com/delanoyoder/ElectromagneticallyInducedTransparency

# Go into the repository
$ cd ElectromagneticallyInducedTransparency

# Create a venv
$ python3 -m venv venv

# Install dependencies
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Navigate to the repository's directory and run the main Python file to initiate the EIT simulation:

```bash
# Navigate to the code directory
$ cd src

# Run the main Python file
$ python EIT.py
```

Different parameters can be tested and compared by modifying the relevant sections of the code as described in the comments and documentation provided within the code files.

## Contribute

Contributions to enhance and optimize the EIT code are welcomed:

- Fork the repository
- Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b feature_branch`)
- Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add some feature'`)
- Push to the branch (`git push origin feature_branch`)
- Create a new Pull Request
