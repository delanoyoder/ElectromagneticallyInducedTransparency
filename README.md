# ElectromagneticallyInducedTransparency
This repository contains the code from a project I completed in 2020 for my graduate degree. The project was to simulate the Electromagnetically Induced Transparency (EIT) effect in a theoretical quantum system. The code is written in Python and uses the NumPy and Matplotlib libraries. The code is written in a modular fashion, so that different parameters can be tested and compared.
